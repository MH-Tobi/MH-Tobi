# What can I tell you about myself?

Mhhh... I come from Germany and live just under an hour south of Berlin.
I am 36 years young :baby: and currently looking for a new professional challenge.

I am a qualified automotive mechatronics technician and a graduate in automotive engineering.

Over the past 8 years, I have gained some professional experience as a project engineer for testing and validation in the automotive sector (including for BMW and MAN).

During this time, in addition to test development, I also developed various tools for test automation.
Among other things, I created an Excel add-in to simplify test management, test development, and test analysis.
Furthermore, I developed a Python tool that automatically defines and creates API interface tests for Ethernet/SomeIP communication.
